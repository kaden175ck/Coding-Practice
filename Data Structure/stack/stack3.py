# **Problem Description**

# You're given an array `temperatures` where `temperatures[i]` is the daily temperature on day `i`. Your task is to return an array where each element represents how many days you have to wait until a warmer temperature occurs. If there's no future day with a warmer temperature, put a 0 in that position.

# **Example:**

# * **Input:** temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73] 
# * **Output:** [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]

# **Stack-based Solution**
