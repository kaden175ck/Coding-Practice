# 5. **Check If N and Its Double Exist (Easy)**
#    - **Problem**: Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exists two indices i and j such that:
#      - `i != j`
#      - `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`
#    - **Example**: Input: `arr = [10,2,5,3]`, Output: `true` (Because 10 is twice as 5, which is an element at a different index).
