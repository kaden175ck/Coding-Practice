# 1. **Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits (Easy)**
#    - **Problem**: Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.
#    - **Example**: If the input is `nums = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]`, the output should be `2` (because 12 and 7896 have an even number of digits).
