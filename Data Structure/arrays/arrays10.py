# 5. **Find the Duplicate Number (Medium)**:
#    - **Problem**: Given an array of integers `nums` containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
#    - **Note**: Must not modify the array (assume the array is read only) and use only constant extra space.
