# * **Implement Queue using Stacks ([https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/]
#(https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/))**   
#The counterpart to the previous problem, 
#this reinforces how you can manipulate data structures to achieve different functionalities.
# Approach: Similar to "Implement Stack using Queues", 
# but now implement FIFO behavior of a queue using two stacks. 
# Focus on how you transfer elements between stacks during push and pop operations.
