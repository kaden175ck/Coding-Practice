    Three ways to do CSS,
    1. inline with HTML tag
    2. style tag within head tag
    3. external CSS file
    </p>

    <p>Classes are more powerful than ID, bc you can use it multiple times</p>
    <P>Can only have one id on HTML element</P>
    <P>but can have as many class as you want</P>
    <P>class and ids kind of the same job</P>
</main>

<h1 id = "external-h1">Another Header using same id so same color</h1>
